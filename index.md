I am an ecologist specializing in **individual-based models** and **disease ecology**. My research focuses on understanding how diseases spread within and between wildlife populations. I use individual-based models to simulate complex ecological dynamics at the individual level and aim to uncover the nuances of disease transmission. My research bridges ecology and data science, aiming to support conservation efforts, disease management, biodiversity and health. 

In my work, I analyse population dynamics, species interactions, individual behaviour, decision making, movement and the ecological impacts of diseases. I am developing robust, predictive models that help address challenges in wildlife health and ecosystem stability. I work on advancing knowledge in wildlife disease ecology and contributing to solutions for conservation and ecosystem management.
