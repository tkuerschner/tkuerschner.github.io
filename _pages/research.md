# Understanding Host-Pathogen Dynamics through individual decision making and population density

Infectious diseases are an increasing threat to biodiversity and human health. Developing a thorough understanding of the factors driving host-pathogen dynamics is therefore essential in both ecological and epidemiological research. Disease dynamics are fundamentally shaped by host-pathogen interactions at various spatial and temporal scales. Individual decision-making processes, especially movement choices as adaptive responses to environmental changes, play a central role in disease transmission. Accordingly, simulation models that aim to predict realistic host-pathogen dynamics must account for individual behaviours and life-history traits of host organisms. Individual- or agent-based models, which capture the variability in host behaviours, offer new approaches and insights into the study of disease dynamics.

## Wildlife disease dynamics: Linking host and pathogen traits

| Pathogens are a fundamental component of biodiversity, significantly impacting host population dynamics and playing a crucial role in shaping community structures. In this project, we aim to understand how species, acting as "mobile pathogen links" with their diverse movement patterns and life-history strategies, influence the distribution, spread, persistence, and evolution of diseases. This project was part of the [BioMove](https://www.bio-move.org/) research training group.

## Wildlife disease dynamics: Management of an invasive parasite

| Managing pathogens with heteroxenous or paratenic life stages is a complex undertaking due to multiple hosts and life stages. These parasites can survive  alternative hosts or environmental conditions, invalidating many control strategies in the process. Additionally, Spill-over or unintended infection poses a significant risk to other species. Fascioloides magna (Giant American Liver Fluke), a large parasitic flatworm (4-10cm) , utilizes snails as intermediate hosts and cervids (including red deer, fallow deer, and Sika deer) as definitive hosts.
