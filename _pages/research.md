# Understanding Host-Pathogen Dynamics through individual decision making and population density

Infectious diseases are an increasing threat to biodiversity and human health. Developing a thorough understanding of the factors driving host-pathogen dynamics is therefore essential in both ecological and epidemiological research. Disease dynamics are fundamentally shaped by host-pathogen interactions at various spatial and temporal scales. Individual decision-making processes, especially movement choices as adaptive responses to environmental changes, play a central role in disease transmission. Accordingly, simulation models that aim to predict realistic host-pathogen dynamics must account for individual behaviours and life-history traits of host organisms. Individual- or agent-based models, which capture the variability in host behaviours, offer new approaches and insights into the study of disease dynamics.

## Wildlife disease dynamics: Linking host and pathogen traits

| Pathogens are a fundamental component of biodiversity, significantly impacting host population dynamics and playing a crucial role in shaping community structures. In this work, we aim to understand how species, acting as "mobile pathogen links" with their diverse movement patterns and life-history strategies, influence the distribution, spread, persistence, and evolution of diseases. | ![image-right](/assets/images/model1.gif){: .align-right width="75%"}|
