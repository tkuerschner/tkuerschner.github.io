# Understanding Host-Pathogen Dynamics through individual decision making and population density


## Wildlife disease dynamics: Linking host and pathogen traits

| Pathogens are a fundamental component of biodiversity, significantly impacting host population dynamics and playing a crucial role in shaping community structures. In this work, we aim to understand how species, acting as "mobile pathogen links" with their diverse movement patterns and life-history strategies, influence the distribution, spread, persistence, and evolution of diseases. | ![image-right](/assets/images/model1.gif){: .align-right width="75%"}|
