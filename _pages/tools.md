# [Movement Diagnostic Tool](https://tkuerschner.shinyapps.io/movement-diagnostic/)

Quick diagnostic tool to visually assess animal telemetry data by displaying general information about movement tracks, such as step length and turning angles. Additionally, it can calculate kernel density estimates (KDEs) and display them on a map.

# [Optimal Radius Assessment Tool](https://github.com/tkuerschner/RestrictionZoneTool)

One of the main control strategies of African Swine Fever involves establishing restricted zones around outbreaks, i.e., areas with temporary restrictions on access and hunting. This tool is designed to show optimal radii for these restriction zones in selectable areas across europe.

# [The Archivist](https://github.com/tkuerschner/the_archivist/)

Small tool for managing a large amount of files for archiving. Multi-file model outputs, especially when many simulations are run can pile up very fast. This tool can help to easily archive them and removes a lot of manual labor.
